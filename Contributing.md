## Developers' Guide

This document describes how to contribute to hyperbench project. It is an entry point for developers who are interested in build, develop, create an issue or pull request to hyperbench.

### Building and Testing

**1. clone**

```shell
git clone git@github.com:meshplus/hyperbench.git
```

**2. build**

```shell
make build
```

**3. run test**

```shell
make test
```

### Workflow

**1. fork**

visit https://github.com/meshplus/hyperbench, click `fork` button

**2. clone**

We assume that you have `go` v1.13 installed, and `GOPATH` is set.

Create your clone:

```Shell
git clone git@github.com:$user/hyperbench.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/meshplus/hyperbench
```

**3. fetch && rebase**

Get your local master up to date:

```Shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/meshplus/hyperbench
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git rebase upstream/master
npm install
```

**4. branch**

Branch from it:

```Shell
git checkout -b myfeature
```

Then edit code on the `myfeature` branch.

**5. commit**

If already run `npm install` ,use `git cz` instead of`git commit`. If not,  use `git commit`.

```Shell
git cz
```

**6. push**

When ready to review (or just to establish an offsite backup or your work), push your branch to your fork on `github.com`:

```Shell
git push -f ${your_remote_name} myfeature
```

**7. create pull request**

1. Visit your fork at <https://github.com/$user/hyperbench>
2. Click the `Compare & Pull Request` button next to your `myfeature` branch.
